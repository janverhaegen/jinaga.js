# Contributing

I have a vision for historical modeling, but I need your help to realize this vision in JavaScript. Here are some of the ways you can help.

## Building

Clone the repository and build the code. You will need to:

Once:

- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/)

Each time you pull:

- Run `npm ci`

As you work:

- Run `npm run test:watch` to compile and run the tests during development

## Testing

Follow the instructions on [jinaga.com](https://jinaga.com) to create a new app.
Let me know what issues you find.
Open [issues](https://github.com/jinaga/jinaga/issues) in this repository.

## Recommendations

Create [issues](https://github.com/jinaga/jinaga/issues) for anything you would like to see changed. We will discuss it in the public arena. Keep in mind, however, that recommendations for changes are to be defended. Be prepared to provide evidence that it makes the system more resilient, more secure, or easier to use. Personal preference is not evidence.

## Sending pull requests

Before making large changes, please let me know what you are working on. Comment on an issue, or open a new one.

Clone the repository in GitHub. Create a branch. Make your changes. Submit a pull request from your working branch against master.

If you prefer some other repository host, please open an issue and paste in your git URL and working branch name.

## Asking questions

Reach out to me on Twitter [@michaellperry](https://twitter.com/michaellperry). Ask me about the library in particular, or historical modeling in general. 

## Spreading the word

When you talk about the project, you can send people to http://jinaga.com. That will take them to this repository until I create a home page for the library. Then it will take them to documentation on getting started and a reference manual.

When you talk about historical modeling in general, you can send people to https://immutablearchitecture.com. The book The Art of Immutable Architecture describes the principles of building distributed systems using immutable data structures. Jinaga is a realization of those principles.
